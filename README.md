Power BI Revenue Modeling Dashboard
📊 Project Overview

This dashboard was created as part of a Power BI Workshop (July 2024), where I learned the fundamentals of data visualization, modeling, and storytelling using Microsoft Power BI. The dataset used was a dummy financial dataset provided during the workshop to simulate real-world business scenarios.

In October 2025, I revisited this dataset and made a few modifications and refinements to the visuals — focusing on layout improvements, data interactions, and key financial metrics — to strengthen my practical understanding of Power BI.
